# Here are the first 6 flights
head(myDF)
# and the last 6 flights
tail(myDF)

# In particular, here are airports that were the 
# origins of the first 6 flights
head(myDF$Origin)
# and the airports that were the origins of the last 6 flights
tail(myDF$Origin)

# Here are the destination airports of the
# first and last 6 flights, respectively.
head(myDF$Dest)

# Here is the information about the first 6 flights that
# had IND as the origin
head(myDF$Origin == "IND")

sum(myDF$Origin == "IND")
# FALSE values converted to 0's
# TRUE values converted to 1's
# sum just adds up the total,
# which yields the number of flights departing from Indy in 2008
# There were 42750 such flights,
# which had IND as the origin

# Similarly, we had 42732 flights with IND as the destination
sum(myDF$Dest == "IND")

# Created a smaller data frame with *only* the flights
# in which IND is the origin city
MyIndyOrigins <- subset(myDF, myDF$Origin == "IND")

# Similarly we made a data frame with the flights
# for which IND is the destination city
IndianapolisDestinations <- subset(myDF, myDF$Dest == "IND")

# Here are the first 6 flights of each of those new data frames.
head(MyIndyOrigins)

# How many flights had IND as the origin city
# during each month of the year
table(MyIndyOrigins$Month)
# Now we can plot that data easily

table(IndianapolisDestinations$Month)

# Again, here are the first 6 flights for which IND is the origin

# again, sum up TRUE's and FALSE's as 1's and 0's resp.

# Note to ourselves: the na.rm means to remove any values that
# were not known, i.e., that were appearing as "NA"

# Altogether we had 42011 flights departing by midnight
# and 739 flights that had NA for the departure time.

sort(table(myDF$Origin))

# here are some sample departure times

# we might want to break them up into these categories

# Here is the corresponding plot

plot(table(cut(myDF$DepTime, breaks=seq(0, 2400, by=100))))

# Here are the most popular 20 such pairs.
